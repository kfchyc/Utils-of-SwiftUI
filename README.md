# Utils-of-SwiftUI
Functions and extensions I most used in my SwiftUI projects.

Some of the code is from others' templates. Thanks to people all around the world who enthusiastically interested in SwiftUI, I got much more easier while developing my side project using SwiftUI. 

So I chose to share these code as templates on Github and I wish this could be helpful. 

Instructions and Examples will updated few days later and the code template will get updated after I make sure that some of these code could be more generic useful.
